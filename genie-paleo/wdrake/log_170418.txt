       * GENIE grid will be loaded directly from k1 or mask text file: wdrake
>   2. CREATING GENIE GRID ...
       - GENIE grid generated.
>   3. READING AXES INFORMATION ...
         (Nothing to load.)
>   4. READING MASK & TOPO GRIDS ...
       - k1 read.
       - GENIE grid re-generated.
>   5. RE-GRIDING MASK ...
         (Nothing to do ... k1/mask file already loaded.)
>   6. RE-GRIDING TOPOGRAPHY ...
         (Nothing to re-grid -- set uniform ocean depth.)
       * Final land area fraction   = 0.023148
>   9. RE-GRIDING OCEAN BATHYMETRY ...
       - Bathymetry re-gridding complete.
>  12. CALCULATING RUN-OFF AND GENERATE .k1 FILE ...

       - .paths file saved
>  16. GENERATING .psiles FILE ...
       - .psiles file saved
>  17. CREATING WIND PRODUCTS ...
       * No Northern gateway found.
