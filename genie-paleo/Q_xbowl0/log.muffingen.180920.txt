   Hello! Welcome to muffingen v0.63
   We are going to make a GREAT model configuration!

>   1. CHECKING PRIMARY OPTIONS ...
       * GCM == hadcm3 (OK)
>   2. CREATING GENIE GRID ...
       - GENIE grid generated.
>   3. READING AXES INFORMATION ...
       - Axis info read.
>   4. READING MASK & TOPO GRIDS ...
       - Mask & topo info read.
>   5. RE-GRIDING MASK ...
       - Mask re-gridded.
       * Original land area fraction    = 0.28944
