   Hello! Welcome to muffingen v0.32
   We are going to make a GREAT model configuration!
------------------------------------------------------------
 
>   1. CHECKING PRIMARY OPTIONS ...
       * GENIE grid will be loaded directly from k1 or mask text file: worsr1
>   2. CREATING GENIE GRID ...
       - GENIE grid generated.
>   3. READING AXES INFORMATION ...
         (Nothing to load.)
>   4. READING MASK & TOPO GRIDS ...
       - k1 read.
       - GENIE grid re-generated.
>   5. RE-GRIDING MASK ...
         (Nothing to do ... k1/mask file already loaded.)
>   6. RE-GRIDING TOPOGRAPHY ...
         (Nothing to re-grid -- convertrf k1 file data.)
       * Final land area fraction   = 0.25
>   9. RE-GRIDING OCEAN BATHYMETRY ...
         (Nothing to re-grid as k1 file already loaded.)
>  12. CALCULATING RUN-OFF AND GENERATE .k1 FILE ...
       * Creating random runoff ...
       - .k1 file saved
>  13. IDENTIFY ISLANDS ...
       * found 1 land masses
>  14. UPDATING ISLANDS & PATHS ...
       * updated find: N-S connected polar island
       * total # true islands = 0
>  15. GENERATING .paths FILE ...
       - .paths file saved
>  16. GENERATING .psiles FILE ...
       - .psiles file saved
       ! Something odd about the islands count or configuration ...
>  17. CREATING WIND PRODUCTS ...
       * No Northern gateway found.
       * No Southern gateway found.
       - Generated zonal wind products.
>  18. LOADING ALBEDO DATA ...
         (Nothing to load.)
>  19. CREATING ALBEDO DATA ...
       - Created generic zonal mean albedo profile.
       - .albd.dat file saved
>  20. GENERATING SEDIMENT TOPO ...
       - Created randomized sediment topography (nothing to re-grid).
       - .depth.dat saved
       - template file .sedcoremask.dat saved
       - template file .reefmask.dat saved
>  21. GENERATING CONFIG FILE PARAMETER LINES ...
       - .config file saved

   Congratulations! SOMETHING was created ... 
   ... hope it was what you wished for! :o)
