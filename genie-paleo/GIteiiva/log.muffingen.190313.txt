   Hello! Welcome to muffingen v0.73
   We are going to make a GREAT model configuration!

>   1. CHECKING PRIMARY OPTIONS ...
       * GCM == hadcm3 (OK)
>   2. CREATING GENIE GRID ...
       - GENIE grid generated.
>   3. READING AXES INFORMATION ...
       - Axis info read.
>   4. READING MASK & TOPO GRIDS ...
       - Mask & topo info read.
>   5. RE-GRIDING MASK ...
       - Mask re-gridded.
       * Original land area fraction    = 0.33189
       * Re-gridded land area fraction  = 0.32099
>   6. FILTERING MASK ...
       - Single cell embayments filtered out.
       - Polar connections cleaned up.
       * found 1 water masses
       * found 2 water masses
       * found 3 water masses
       - Small water bodies cleaned up.

>   7. USER EDITING OF MASK ...
       * Mask alteration procedure :
         (1) left button to turn grid cell to ocean
         (2) right button to turn grid cell to land
         (3) middle button, or clickoutside the grid, to finish
       - Out of grid range
       * Mask alteration complete
       * Revised land area fraction = 0.33951
