   Hello! Welcome to muffingen v0.79
   We are going to make a GREAT model configuration!
------------------------------------------------------------
 
>   1. CHECKING PRIMARY OPTIONS ...
       * GENIE grid will be loaded directly from k1, mask, or k2 text file: crw_hi_c
>   2. CREATING GENIE GRID ...
       - GENIE grid generated.
>   3. READING AXES INFORMATION ...
         (Nothing to load.)
>   4. READING MASK & TOPO GRIDS ...
       - k1 read.
       - GENIE grid re-generated.
>   5. RE-GRIDING MASK ...
         (Nothing to do ... k1/mask/k2 file already loaded.)
>   6. FILTERING MASK ...
       * found 1 water masses
       - Small water bodies cleaned up.
       * Revised land area fraction = 0.22222
>   8. CREATE FINAL MASK ...
       - .mask_out.FINAL.dat saved
       * Final land area fraction   = 0.22222
>   9. RE-GRIDING TOPOGRAPHY ...
         (Nothing to re-grid -- convert k1 file data.)
>   10. RE-GRIDING OCEAN BATHYMETRY ...
         (Nothing to re-grid as k1 file already loaded.)
>  13. CALCULATING RUN-OFF AND GENERATE .k1 FILE ...
       - .k1 file saved
>  14. IDENTIFY ISLANDS ...
       * found 1 land masses
>  15. UPDATING ISLANDS & PATHS ...
       * updated find: N-S connected polar island
       * total # true islands = 1
>  16. GENERATING .paths FILE ...
       * Creating raw path #1 ...
       - .paths file saved
>  17. GENERATING .psiles FILE ...
       - .psiles file saved
>  19. SWITCH GRIDS ...
         (Nothing to re-read.)
>  19. CREATING WIND PRODUCTS ...
       * No Northern gateway found.
       * No Southern gateway found.
       - Generated zonal wind products.
>  20. LOADING ALBEDO DATA ...
         (Nothing to load.)
>  21. CREATING ALBEDO DATA ...
       - Created generic zonal mean albedo profile.
       - .albd.dat file saved
>  22. GENERATING CONFIG FILE PARAMETER LINES ...
       - .config file saved

   Congratulations! SOMETHING was created ... 
   ... hope it was what you wished for! :o)
