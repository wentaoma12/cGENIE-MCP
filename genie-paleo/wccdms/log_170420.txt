   Hello! Welcome to muffingen v0.32
   We are going to make a GREAT model configuration!
------------------------------------------------------------

>   3. READING AXES INFORMATION ...
         (Nothing to load.)
>   4. READING MASK & TOPO GRIDS ...
       - k1 read.
       - GENIE grid re-generated.
>   5. RE-GRIDING MASK ...
         (Nothing to do ... k1/mask file already loaded.)
>   6. RE-GRIDING TOPOGRAPHY ...
         (Nothing to re-grid -- set uniform ocean depth.)
       * Final land area fraction   = 0.17515
>   9. RE-GRIDING OCEAN BATHYMETRY ...
       - Bathymetry re-gridding complete.
>  12. CALCULATING RUN-OFF AND GENERATE .k1 FILE ...
       * Creating random runoff ...
       - .k1 file saved
>  13. IDENTIFY ISLANDS ...
       * found 1 land masses
       * found 2 land masses
       * found 3 land masses
       * found 4 land masses
       * found 5 land masses
>  14. UPDATING ISLANDS & PATHS ...
       * updated find: 1 islands
       * updated find: 2 islands
       * updated find: 3 islands
       * updated find: 4 islands
       * updated find: 5 islands
       * updated find: N pole island (currently uncounted)
       * updated find: S pole island (currently uncounted)
       * total # true islands = 6
