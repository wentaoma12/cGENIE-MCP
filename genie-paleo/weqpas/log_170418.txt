   Hello! Welcome to muffingen v0.31.
   We are going to make a GREAT model configuration!
------------------------------------------------------------
 
>   1. CHECKING PRIMARY OPTIONS ...
       * GENIE grid will be loaded directly from k1 or mask text file: weqpas
>   2. CREATING GENIE GRID ...
       - GENIE grid generated.
>   3. READING AXES INFORMATION ...
         (Nothing to load.)
>   4. READING MASK & TOPO GRIDS ...
       - k1 read.
       - GENIE grid re-generated.
>   5. RE-GRIDING MASK ...
         (Nothing to do ... k1/mask file already loaded.)
>   6. RE-GRIDING TOPOGRAPHY ...
         (Nothing to re-grid -- set uniform ocean depth.)
       * Final land area fraction   = 0.018519
>   9. RE-GRIDING OCEAN BATHYMETRY ...
       - Bathymetry re-gridding complete.
>  12. CALCULATING RUN-OFF AND GENERATE .k1 FILE ...
       * Creating random runoff ...
       - .k1 file saved
>  13. IDENTIFY ISLANDS ...
       * found 1 land masses
       * found 2 land masses
>  14. UPDATING ISLANDS & PATHS ...
       * updated find: 1 islands
       * updated find: 2 islands
       * total # true islands = 1
>  15. GENERATING .paths FILE ...
       * Building path #2 ...
         -> NE corner :: Skip path entry @ (2,13)
         -> SE corner :: Add additional path entry @ (2,1)
       - .paths file saved
>  16. GENERATING .psiles FILE ...
       - .psiles file saved
>  17. CREATING WIND PRODUCTS ...
       * No Northern gateway found.
       * No Southern gateway found.
       - Generated zonal wind products.
>  21. GENERATING CONFIG FILE PARAMETER LINES ...
       - .config file saved
